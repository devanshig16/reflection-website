          I explored how each personaâ€”like first-year undergrads, grad students, exchange students, and student leadersâ€”interacts differently with bureaucratic tasks. Using AI helped me understand which app features would matter most to each group and how I could personalize guidance. It felt like getting mini focus groups instantly.

      learning: "This week, I built my Bureaucracy Buddy prototype using multiple AI platforms. I learned how to combine Bolt.new for frontend development, ChatGPTâ€™s API for a contextual chatbot, and Gradio for document upload demos. Working through the project helped me understand the strengths and limitations of each platform, and how to leverage them together to solve a real-world problem. I also learned the importance of planning user flows and integrating features conceptually, even when full technical integration isnâ€™t possible within a short timeframe. Testing and iterating on the prototype showed me how small changesâ€”like clarifying instructions in the chatbot or improving the document upload interfaceâ€”can greatly improve usability.",

          As an international student myself, I can see how the features I built could
          directly help new students navigating banking, visas, and healthcare. Designing the app allowed me to apply concepts from class while thinking practically about user experience. It was rewarding to simulate how someone would actually use the app, seeing how AI could make complex bureaucratic processes simpler and more approachable. It also made me reflect on my own experiences as a student and how tools like this could have helped me earlier.

I learned to prioritize features and focus on what would be most valuable to the user while maintaining a clean and responsive interface.",
